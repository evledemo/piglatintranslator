## Features

- Words that start with a consonant have their first letter moved to the end of the word and the
letters "ay" added to the end (Hello becomes Ellohay).
- Words that start with a vowel have the letters "way" added to the end (apple becomes appleway).
- Words that end in "way" are not modified (stairway stays as stairway).
- Punctuation remain in the same relative place from the end of the word (can’t becomes
antca’y, end. becomes endway.).
- Hyphens are treated as two words (this-thing becomes histay-hingtay).
- Capitalization remain in the same place (Beach becomes Eachbay, McCloud becomes
CcLoudmay).
